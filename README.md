# FIFA-Dataset-Cleaning

In this data cleaning project, our objective is to enhance the quality and integrity of a dataset related to FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association). The dataset contains information about football players, matches, teams, and other relevant metrics associated with the football world. Data cleaning is a critical step in data analysis, ensuring the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for meaningful insights. The cleaning process involves identifying and addressing various data quality issues, such as missing values, inconsistent data formats, errors, and outliers.

By executing these steps systematically, we aim to deliver a FIFA dataset that is reliable, accurate, and well-prepared for exploratory data analysis and other advanced analytical tasks related to football.
